    The need to distinguish between the various meanings of "frame of
    reference" has led to a variety of terms. For example, sometimes the type
    of coordinate system is attached as a modifier, as in Cartesian frame of
    reference. Sometimes the state of motion asfda asd s fdas sfdfasdfasdf is
    emphasized, as in rotating frame of reference. Sometimes
